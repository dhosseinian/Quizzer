# Quizzer
This program was created for the Commack High School Quiz Bowl team, providing the coach with the opportunity to evaluate players by asking trivia questions.
Quizzer has two interfaces, one for the coach, and one for the players.
On the coach's interface, the user is able to assign questions, manage players and teams, and view player performances.
On the player's interface, the user is able to answer questions, view his or her personal performance, and manage the account.
Quizzer was designed to be placed on the Commack High School server, which can be accessed remotely.
### HOW TO USE
The data for Quizzer is stored in a "data" folder, which must be located in the same directory as the built program file.
Upon first use, there are no player accounts, and they can only be created by the coach, who has the following login information:

Username - user

Password - pass

On this repository, the built file and the "data" folder are located in the "dist" folder
